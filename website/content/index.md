# UOR Foundation

The Universal Object Reference (UOR) Framework is a formal mathematical framework
for content-addressed, algebraically-structured object spaces.

**Key features:**
- Ring substrate Z/(2^n)Z with canonical two-involution structure
- Dihedral group D_{2^n} generated by ring negation and bitwise complement
- The critical identity: `neg(bnot(x)) = succ(x) for all x ∈ R_n`
- 14 namespaces covering addressing, schema, operations, resolution, state, and more
- Full OWL 2 DL ontology with SHACL shapes and RDF serialization

[Browse the ontology namespaces](/namespaces/) or [read the documentation](/docs/overview.html).
