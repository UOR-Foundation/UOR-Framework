# About UOR Foundation

The UOR Foundation develops the Universal Object Reference specification —
a formal ontology for content-addressed, symmetric, multi-metric object spaces.

## Mission

To provide a rigorous, open, machine-verifiable specification for the algebraic
structure of digital information, enabling interoperability across systems that
represent, resolve, and transform computable objects.

## License

All UOR Foundation specifications and implementations are published under the
Apache 2.0 license.

## Repository

The canonical implementation is at
[github.com/UOR-Foundation/UOR-Framework](https://github.com/UOR-Foundation/UOR-Framework).
