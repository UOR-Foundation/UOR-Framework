//! UOR Foundation — typed Rust traits for the complete ontology.
//!
//! Version: 2.0.0
//!
//! This crate exports every ontology class as a trait, every property as a
//! method, and every named individual as a constant. Implementations (like
//! PRISM) import these traits and provide concrete types.
//!
//! # Primitives
//!
//! All traits are generic over [`Primitives`], a type family that lets
//! implementors choose their own concrete representations for XSD types.
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! struct MyImpl;
//! impl uor_foundation::Primitives for MyImpl {
//!     type String = str;
//!     type Integer = i64;
//!     type NonNegativeInteger = u64;
//!     type PositiveInteger = u64;
//!     type Decimal = f64;
//!     type Boolean = bool;
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Module Structure
//!
//! - [`kernel`] — Immutable foundation: addressing, schema, operations
//! - [`bridge`] — Kernel-computed, user-consumed: queries, resolution, partitions, proofs
//! - [`user`] — Runtime declarations: types, morphisms, state
